  Computer Vision algorithms enables computers to capture images and process the captured data to obtain useful results. The capturing is done usually through cameras interfaced to the processing devise(Computer).

  Today, images and video are everywhere. Online photo-sharing sites and social net-
works have them in the billions. Search engines will produce images of just about any conceivable query. Practically all phones and computers come with built-in cameras.It is not uncommon for people to have many gigabytes of photos and videos on their devices.

  Programming a computer and designing algorithms for understanding what is in these images is the field of computer vision. Computer vision powers applications like image search, robot navigation, medical image analysis, photo management, and many more."(from Programming Computer Vision using Python-Jan Erik Solem)
